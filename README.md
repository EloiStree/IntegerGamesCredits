You can use RSA key to interact with your online variable.
But if you prefer other ways to interact.
- Twitch Chat,
- Discord chat,
- Youtube Comment,
- A hosting web page,
- ...


  
This git allows to authorize platform interaction.  
And keep track of who is currently subscribing to the project.  
(You can still be anonyme by just using your RSA key)
